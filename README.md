# Expense Tracking System

## Description
This is a simple Spring Boot-based application that allows users to track their expenses. The system allows users to:
- Create new users
- Record transactions for users
- Upload files associated with transactions (stored in Amazon S3)
  
The system uses:
- **Spring Boot** for the backend development.
- **JPA** (Java Persistence API) for working with relational databases (MySQL or PostgreSQL) to store user, transaction data and file metadata
- **Amazon S3** for file storage.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** for the backend
- **JPA / Hibernate** for database interaction
- **Amazon S3** for file storage
- **Lombok** for reducing boilerplate code
